# Questions

## Technical:
* Is this project going to expand to include more tiles in the future (does it need to be scalable)?
* How important is having an offline model? (Online models need internet connection to work)
* In terms of requirements, do you have specific accuracy, speed, or ... in mind?
* How do we deploy the model?
* What are the preferences in UI or visualization of the models results (A website, mobile app, something else?)?
* What resources are available? Any knowledge (people, books) or computing power available?

## General:
* What is the main problem?
* Who are the main users of this system? (What are their technical skills?)
* Has there been any attempts to do this project before? If yes, why did they fail?
* What is the gold standard now when a rooftile needs to be categorized? (for example an expert builder?) What is their accuracy?
* Are there any privacy or security concerns in this project?
* What criteria will you use to measure the succes off the model?
* What are the main challenges you want the model to address?
* Is there a required workflow? (Scrum, waterfall, etc)
* Should your help be needed, how do we meet?

## Data:
* How many images are available? In total, per type, how many types, how many brands?
* Is it possible to get more images if needed?
* Is it OK to have multiple pictures from the tile to predict its type? (front and back images together)
* If we want to add additional pictures, what criteria do they need to adhere to?
* what is the size, color and dimensions of the rooftile? Does this differ a lot?
* How are the images currently labeled/annotated in the dataset?
* What are the key differences we need to detect in the rooftiles?
