\section{Introduction}

\begin{fullwidth}
    In this report, 
    we detail the process of selecting an AI model for the specific task of classifying roofiles. 
    Out of the selected algorithm two models will be built, one for the front-side and one for the back-side of the rooftile. 
    As discussed in our analysis, 9 different rooftiles will be considered and before training them in a model 
    they will be categorized in their own subfolder, within either a train or test folder.

    We will explain what algorithm we chose based on tests done with the model. These tests will be discussed in the following sections.
    From a wide plethora of algorithms that are available a few are compared in this document:
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item VGG 16
    \item VGG 19
    \item Resnet
    \item YOLOv5
    \item EfficientNet
    \end{itemize}
